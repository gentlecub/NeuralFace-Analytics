## 🧠 How It Works

1. 📷 **Image Capture or Upload**  
   The system accepts images or real-time video feed as input.

2. 🖼 **Face Detection**  
   Detects and isolates facial regions using advanced face detection algorithms.

3. 🔍 **Feature Extraction**  
   Extracts key facial landmarks and features for analysis.

4. 🧮 **Neural Network Prediction**  
   Deep learning models classify age, gender, and emotions.

5. 📊 **Results Display**  
   Outputs classifications along with confidence scores.

## 🧠 How It Works

The application follows these key steps:

1. 🔐 **Login System**  
   Users authenticate through a login screen. Role-based access determines available features.

2. 📂 **Data Import**  
   Car sales data is loaded from CSV files and stored in a **MySQL** database (`MySql/` folder).

3. 🧹 **Data Cleaning & Processing**  
   Leveraging **Pandas**, the data is cleaned, validated, and transformed for analysis.

4. 📊 **Data Visualization**  
   Charts and graphs are generated with **Matplotlib** to facilitate insight discovery.

5. 🧾 **User Interface**  
   A simple, menu-driven console UI allows users to explore data visually or in table format.
